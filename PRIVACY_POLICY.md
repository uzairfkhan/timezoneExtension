# Privacy Policy for Timezone Converter

**Last Updated:** February 2025

## Overview

Timezone Converter is a browser extension that helps users convert times between different timezones. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** Specifically:

- **No personal information** is collected, stored, or transmitted
- **No browsing history** is accessed or recorded
- **No analytics or tracking** tools are used
- **No cookies** are created or stored
- **No data is sent** to external servers

## How the Extension Works

The Timezone Converter extension operates entirely locally on your device:

1. **Time Conversion**: When you enter a time in the popup, the conversion is performed locally using your browser's built-in timezone data. No data leaves your device.

2. **Context Menu**: When you select text on a webpage and use "Convert to my timezone", the selected text is processed locally. The extension only reads the specific text you have selected and highlighted.

3. **Clipboard**: When you click the copy button, the converted time is copied to your local clipboard. This is a standard browser function and no data is transmitted externally.

4. **Timezone Detection**: Your local timezone is detected using your browser's built-in `Intl.DateTimeFormat` API. This information stays on your device.

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests minimal permissions:

- **contextMenus**: Allows the extension to add a "Convert to my timezone" option when you right-click on selected text. This permission does not grant access to your browsing data.

## Data Storage

The extension does not store any data:

- No local storage is used
- No cookies are created
- No files are written to your device
- No preferences or settings are saved (the extension uses your browser's timezone by default)

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party services, APIs, or analytics platforms. All functionality is self-contained within the extension.

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Since we do not collect any user data, we have no way to notify users of changes, but the current policy will always be available in the extension's repository and store listing.

## Open Source
